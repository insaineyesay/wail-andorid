What am I learning. Using this to track what I've been learning in the android world. This page is super high level. Any topics that require more in depth research will have it's own folder.

## Prelearn

* Observer pattern
* Dependency Injection

## Core

* [Android Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle)
* [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger)
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi)
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/)
  * [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/)
    * [Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-navigation/#0)  
  * [Android LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/)
  * Abstraction layer over SQLLite
* [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing)


## Questions

* How do we handle caching data per user session?
  * Do we need a refresh option?
* Can I use LiveData with retrofit?

## Cool

* [F-Droid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid)
  * Open source "Google play store". Can look up apps and see how they do things.
